# MultiSSH
MultiSSH is a systems administration tool that runs Linux/Unix commands on multiple ssh servers, it is a lightweight command line tool that is easy to setup and use. It is designed to be easily used in scripts or standalone.

Setup
-----

Install dependencies for Debian/Ubuntu, run in your Terminal shell:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libssh-dev
```
Or for Red Hat/CentOS:
```shell
sudo yum install libssh-devel
```
Then compile using make:
```shell
make
```
Or compile manually:
```shell
gcc multissh.c -o multissh -lssh
```
Usage instructions
------------------
You must create a file named 'sshservers' which contains a list of ssh servers and credentials before MultiSSH is run, you must add one line per server, in the format:

sshserverhost:sshserverport:sshserverusername:sshserverpassword

The sshservers.example file is an example of what an 'sshservers' file should look like.

After compiling, MultiSSH can be run as follows:

```shell
./multissh 'command(s)'
```

**Command Line Options:**

- `-f FILE` - Use a custom SSH servers file instead of the default 'sshservers'
- `-s LIST` - Select specific servers using comma-separated server:port list
- `-p PASSWORD` - Password for decrypting an encrypted SSH servers file
- `-h` - Show help message

**Examples:**

Basic usage (uses default 'sshservers' file):
```shell
./multissh 'uptime'
```

Using a custom servers file:
```shell
./multissh -f /path/to/my-servers 'df -h'
```

Selecting specific servers:
```shell
./multissh -s '192.168.1.10:22,192.168.1.11:22' 'ps aux'
```

Combining options:
```shell
./multissh -f production-servers -s '10.0.1.5:22,10.0.1.6:22' 'systemctl status nginx'
```

Using encrypted servers file:
```shell
./multissh -p mypassword 'uptime'
```

Using encrypted custom servers file:
```shell
./multissh -f /path/to/encrypted-servers -p mypassword 'df -h'
```

When running multiple commands, each command must be separated with a semicolon ';' and all commands must be within quotes, for example:
```shell
./multissh 'ps; free -m'
```

**Encrypted SSH Servers Files:**

For added security, you can encrypt your SSH servers file to protect sensitive credentials. MultiSSH includes an encryption utility for this purpose.

To encrypt a plain text servers file:
```shell
./encrypt_servers -p mypassword sshservers.txt sshservers.encrypted
```

To decrypt an encrypted file back to plain text:
```shell
./encrypt_servers -p mypassword -d sshservers.encrypted sshservers.txt
```

To use an encrypted servers file with MultiSSH:
```shell
./multissh -p mypassword 'uptime'
./multissh -f /path/to/encrypted-servers -p mypassword 'df -h'
```

**Note:** The encryption uses AES-128 in ECB mode with password-based key derivation using SHA-256. This provides strong cryptographic protection for your SSH credentials. The first 16 bytes of the SHA-256 hash of your password are used as the AES encryption key.

**Build System:**

Use the provided Makefile for easy building:
```shell
make            # Build multissh and encrypt_servers utilities
make clean      # Clean build artifacts  
make install    # Install to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
make uninstall  # Remove from /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
make check-deps # Check if dependencies are installed
make help       # Show build system help
```
Tested and confirmed working on Ubuntu, CentOS, and OS X. Should work on any Linux distribution and *BSD.
